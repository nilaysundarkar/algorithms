### Loop Invariant

We must show three things about a loop invariant :

###### Initialization
It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop.

###### Maintenance
If it is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.

###### Termination
When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct.
